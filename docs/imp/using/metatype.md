# Metatype configuration

The configuration options on this page remove components from all
dynamic service models.  Every
ZenPack that includes Service Impact relationships is displayed here.

If your Service Impact model is relatively large, you can improve the
speed of both Service Impact and Resource Manager by removing
unimportant components. For example, you may choose to exclude the
server fan or power supply components from virtual machines. When a
component is removed in this way, it no longer appears in the Impact
View of dynamic services, and component events are not considered in
determining the performance or availability of dynamic services.

Zenoss strongly recommends that you contact Zenoss Support to determine
whether your environment can benefit by removing components, and to
select components to remove.
