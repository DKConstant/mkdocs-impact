To prevent sending service events when changes affect a node, check
Suppress service events. Choose this option when a service node is used
solely to group child nodes.

If a custom state provider is not associated with a node, the dialog box
does not contain the option to edit the custom state provider.

For a policy or custom state provider, click Add or Edit to access
options.
