list of its associated members.

# Add to Service dialog box

Use the Add to Service dialog box to find and add members to a service
model.

In the search field, enter the string to find. You can search for a
specific device or component name, or component type (such as interfaces
and OS processes) or group type (such as location and system). As you
type characters, Service Impact displays matches.
