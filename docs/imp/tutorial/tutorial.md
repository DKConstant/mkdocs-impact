# Tutorial: Creating a service model

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a service model for a
simplified CRM application, view the model, and view and interpret the
root-cause analyses that Service Impact creates when events affect the
application's availability state.

About this tutorial:

-   For information about Service Impact browser interface elements, see
    [Service Impact home page](/imp/using/impact-ui.html).
-   Complete the tasks in the order in which they are presented.
-   Where indicated, steps depend on the version of Resource Manager
    with which Service Impact is deployed.
-   Device and component resources for this tutorial are fake, and do
    not affect production environments. The final task erases the fake
    devices and the nodes that you create during the tutorial. For more
    information, see [Tutorial devices and member types](/imp/tutorial/load-members2.html).

The following diagram shows the network topology of the CRM application
that is featured in this tutorial.
