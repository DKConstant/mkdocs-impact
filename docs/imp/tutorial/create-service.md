The CRM application service we will be creating will depend on multiple subservices.
The subservices may contain additional subservices, so the following procedures should be completed in the listed order.

1. [Create a subservice simulating the connection to the Internet](/imp/tutorial/internet.html)
2. [Create a subservice simulating the local network](/imp/tutorial/local-networks.html)
3. [Create a subservice combining the Internet and local network services](/imp/tutorial/network-service.html)
4. [Create the final application service combining the previous services](/imp/tutorial/application-service.html)
