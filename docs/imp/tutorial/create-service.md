# Create the service

All network connections except the connection to the Internet are
modeled. Because the Internet connection is not modeled in Resource
Manager, we create a logical node to represent it. For this tutorial,
the logical node is simply a service model member that reacts to fake
events. A "real" logical node could be configured to react to events
from a zencommand that pings an Internet resource.
